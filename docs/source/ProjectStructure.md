# Project Structure

This project is organized into the following main components:

1. **Memristor_Crossbar.py**: Defines the Memristor Crossbar class, encompassing all methods necessary for training and inference.
2. **Memristor_Crossbar_test.py**: Includes testing functions designed specifically for the Memristor Crossbar class.
3. **experimental_conductances.py**: Includes the load_conductance_data function, which loads and processes conductance data from a specified CSV or .dat file.
4. **training_simulation.py**: Demonstrates how to conduct training simulations. It creates an instance of the memristor crossbar class, defines the training and expected output sets, and integrates the loading of conductance data for a complete training workflow.
