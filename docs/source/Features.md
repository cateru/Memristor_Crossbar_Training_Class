# Features 

Inside the `Memristor_Crossbar.py` module, there are methods that handle the mathematical processes of the training algorithm and perform weight updates. The module also includes methods for plotting key metrics that monitor the training progress, such as activation functions, total distance to convergence, weight updates, and individual activation responses. For users who want to explore the technical details of the algorithm and its code implementation, it's recommended to refer to the appendix.
